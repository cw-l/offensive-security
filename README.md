This repository contains tools, scripts, cheatsheets, exploits, etc., that I used in preparation for my OSCP+ examinations. It will go live once I passed the examination.

For now, you will find [a list of CVEs](ExploitsListing.md) that you might use to gain intial foothold or PE. There would also be CVE folders that contain enhanced scripts to gain intial access or PE.
